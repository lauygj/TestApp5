   <p> The prognosis from a CPG3 cancer is considered intermediate and your risk of dying of prostate cancer is about the same 
   compared to your risk of dying of other causes. This however depends on how old you are, your general state of health and 
   your other medical conditions. There is also be a higher risk of the cancer spreading (metastasis) if left untreated. 
   Treatment is therefore considered likely to confer benefit to you. The National Institute for Health Care Excellence currently 
   recommends that men diagnosed with CPG3 cancer are offered treatment with the intention of cure.</p> 
   <hr>
   <p>Active surveillance however can still be considered if you are not keen on or are unable to proceed with immediate treatment.</p>
