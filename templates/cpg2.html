   <p>The prognosis from a CPG2 cancer is good and your risk of dying of prostate cancer is low compared to your risk of dying of 
   other causes. The risk that the cancer may spread (metastasis) is also usually low. Immediate curative treatment may confer 
   some benefit to you but needs to be weighed against the risk of side effects and complications. 
   The alternative is active surveillance and then treatment if there are signs of change in the cancer. 
   The National Institute for Health Care Excellence currently recommends that men diagnosed with CPG2 cancer are offered a choice 
   between active surveillance and treatment</p>
