		<li>Prostate cancer is relatively unique in that there are a number of management options available.</li>
		<li><b>For localised and locally advanced (non-metastatic prostate cancer).</b></li>
		<li>Your doctor may talk to you about the prognosis of your cancer (which means how likely you are to die from prostate cancer) 
		and therefore the value of immediate treatment.</li>
		<li>To work out this prognosis your doctor will look at your PSA level, your Grade Group (from the biopsy), and the stage of your 
		cancer (from the MRI or clinical examination). This is then used to derive your Cambridge Prognosis Group (CPG).</li>
		<li>Which CPG you are in will help the doctor discuss with you if treatment would be beneficial to you or to consider active 
		surveillance or monitoring instead. This discussion will also including considering any other illness you have and your natural life 
		expectancy and other factors*.</li>
		<li>If treatment is being considered; then the treatments options available for your particular type of cancer and the likely side 
		effects and outcomes can be discussed.</li>
		<li>This tool aims to inform patients of their options, based on the unbiased guidelines issued by National Institute for Health 
		Care Excellence (Nice) for their particular type and stage of prostate cancer.</li>

		<li>Comprehensive information is given for each treatment option â€“ including description of what the treatment involves, risks and 
		benefits of each treatment.</li>
