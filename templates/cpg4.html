   <p>The prognosis from a CPG4 cancer is considered poor if left untreated. Treatment is recommended to reduce the risk that 
   the cancer may spread (metastasis) or cause death. The National Institute for Health Care Excellence currently recommends 
   that men diagnosed with CPG4 cancer are offered treatment with the intention of cure. Active surveillance is not recommended. 
   It may be however that you have very significant other medical conditions that will limit your normal life expectancy and 
   treatment for prostate cancer may do you more harm than good. In this case your doctor will discuss this with you and determine 
   the best option for you.</p>
